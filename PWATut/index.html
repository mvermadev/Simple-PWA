            When launched from the user’s home screen, service workers enable a Progressive Web App to load instantly,
            regardless of the network state.

            A service worker, written in JavaScript, is like a client-side proxy and puts you in control of the cache
            and how to respond to resource requests. By pre-caching key resources you can eliminate the dependence on
            the network, ensuring an instant and reliable experience for your users.

            Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on the user's home screen, without the need for an app store.
            They offer an
            immersive full screen experience with help from a web app manifest file and can even re-engage users with
            web push notifications.
            The Web App Manifest allows you to control how your app appears and how it's launched. You can specify home
            screen icons,
            the page to load when the app is launched, screen orientation, and even whether or not to show the browser
            chrome.

      <h3>What is PWA?</h3>
      <h4> “Progressive Web App (PWA) is a term used to denote a new software development methodology. Unlike
         traditional applications, progressive web apps are a hybrid of regular web pages (or websites) and a mobile
         application. This new application model attempts to combine features offered by most modern browsers with the
         benefits of mobile experience.”
         <br> <br>
         This is what wikipedia says about PWA. Well, this might seem a bit vague or even contentious. So let’s look at
         PWA in an informal way.
         <br> <br>
         If ever the best of web and the best of apps had a clone child — it is PWA. Or else, it’s just that the web
         page has taken all the ‘right vitamins’ so that it can behave more like an app downloaded from the App Store/
         Play Store. It starts as a normal web page in a browser, and as a user explores the webpage, they get the
         prompt if they would like to “Add to Home Screen”. Once the user gives the thumbs up to this prompt, VOILA! PWA
         gets added to their home screen. Once open from the home screen, it can even hide the browser UI controls and
         appear as an app.
         <br> <br>
         This is more like a glorified bookmark that has hit the sweet spot between the web and mobile apps. I say this
         because PWA has managed to bridge the gap in the web. The web has always been thirsty for reliable performance
         at par with the native apps. It has always yearned for a place in the notification tray and in the home screen
         just like an app. More than 40% of the users bounce from the websites that take more than 3 seconds to load.
         PWA is a solution for this “Web Obesity Epidemic” faced by the users.
         <br> <br>
         It is all about removing friction and making it easy for the users to get to what they want.
         <br> <br>
         The entire credit for this seamless experience should be given to the Service Worker( A script that the browser
         runs in the background separate from web page), which is the backbone of every PWA. The service workers enable
         reliable and intelligent caching, background content updating, push notifications and the most attractive
         offline functionality to prior visited sites. This means that, after the first visit to a website, the site and
         app will be reliably fast even on flaky networks.
         <br> <br>
         But a question could arise here — what about the fast first load with reliable performance? That’s when
         Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) meets service worker. AMP provides reliably fast web components for first load.
         These components are much faster to load and less data hungry. Websites that use the combo of AMP and Service
         Worker will provide reliable speed as of native apps. Once the page is loaded the site setups the service
         worker and assets are cached intelligently. This will always keep the PWA up to date thereby freeing the users
         from the frequent updates to be done from the App Store.

      <h3> Why is it important ?</h3>
      <p>
         It is a myth that the users will happily download the app of every website they visit frequently. According to
         Comscore Mobile App Report, over 50% of America’s smart phone users download Zero Apps a month. i.e. Gone are
         the days when the phone is full of apps and people-smart phone honeymoon phase is getting depleted. Each step
         to download an app reduces 20% of users. PWA reduces the steps between discovery of an app and getting it on
         the home screen and thereby eliminates friction of getting an app installed. This provides a very fertile
         ground for businesses to pitch in their PWA.
         <br> <br>
         The following three metrics can be highlighted to understand the importance of PWA in moulding the future web.
         <br> <br>
         a. Reach : The mobile web audience has grown at a skyrocketing pace over the last few years. Google has
         reported that Chrome has whooping 1 billion mobile users compared to the erstwhile 400 million users in 2016.
         As per Comscore’s report the reach of mobile web is 2.5 times more than that of apps, while considering the top
         1000 sites and apps. This is the reason why the decision of Flipkart, Myntra etc. to abandon their website and
         be ‘app only’ backfired. If we could provide a better experience to a wider audience, we could surely get a
         competitive edge over the others.
         <br> <br>
         b. Acquisition : Another serious concern faced by the mobile apps are their user discoverability compared to
         websites. The user acquisition cost of web will be 10 times cheaper than that of native apps. With more
         exposure and low friction for on-boarding, PWA is likely to acquire more users at very less expense.
         <br> <br>
         c. Conversion : The seamless end to end user experience even with flaky networks provided by PWA improves the
         number of successful conversions. Flipkart launched their PWA ‘Flipkart-lite’, which they claim to have
         delivered an increase in the conversion rate by 70% with lower acquisition cost.

         <br> <br>
         To sum up : PWA helps to improve conversions by increasing potential reach with low acquisition costs.
      </p>
      <br> <br>
      <h3>
         How to get started ?
      </h3>
      <p>

         Once you get to know a new technology, the next challenge in-line is the decision to adopt it. Most of the
         people get into a dilemma at this point. Decision should be driven by your specific business need. The
         following two cases could help you identify the method that fits you to implement PWA.
         <br> <br>
         a) From ground zero

         Consider the scenario when a company is building a new website or going through a redesign. In this case,
         building a PWA from ground zero makes sense and is feasible. This will have the business to harness the power
         of PWA with AMP, service workers, App shell and Web Manifest. For e.g.. According to Ali Express, once they
         revamped their website as PWA, they were able to increase their conversion rate for new users by 104%, gained
         2X more pages visited per session per user across all browsers and 74% increase in time spent per session
         across all browsers.
         <br> <br>
         b) A simple version or A Single feature

         When building from scratch is not realistic, one can always build a simple version of the website or focus on a
         single feature that has a high impact for end users. The focus is to deliver a fast, engaging and reliable
         experience. AirBerlin is an appropriate example in this case. They focussed on the post- booking experience in
         their PWA. After a passenger has checked in, they can access their journey details and boarding pass even
         without internet connectivity.
      </p>

      <br> <br>
      <h3>
         Challenges in PWA
      </h3>
      <p>

         There are some challenges in PWA which have to be considered while choosing it.
         <br> <br>
         a) Cross Browser Support : While Chrome, Opera, and Samsung’s android browser supports PWA, IE, Edge and Safari
         are yet to extend their support.
         <br> <br>
         b) Limited Functionality: PWA doesn’t have support for any hardware that is not supported by HTML5
         <br> <br>
         c) Limited Legitimacy: As there is no central download Store for PWA, they lack in giving a sense of legitimacy
         and confidence which is usually given by native apps from Play Store/App Store.
         <br> <br>
         d) Cross Application Login Support : Native apps have the capability to talk to other apps and authenticate
         logins (Facebook, Twitter, Google). As a webpage, PWA doesn’t have the capability to communicate with other
         apps installed.
         <br> <br>
         Conclusion
         We can’t say that PWA will kill Native Apps in the future. But still there is a growing interest for this
         approach in the community. PWAs are still in their infancy with a lot of challenges to be addressed. Yet, they
         have the potential to create a shift in the way the web works.
